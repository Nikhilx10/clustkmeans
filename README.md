K-means clustering in Python is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. Here's a concise overview and example of how to perform K-means clustering using Python's scikit-learn library:

How K-means Works
Choose the number of clusters K.
Randomly initialize centroids for each cluster.
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
Recalculate centroids as the mean of all points in each cluster.
Repeat assignment and centroid update steps until cluster assignments stabilize (no change).
Choosing the Number of Clusters
The "elbow method" is commonly used to find the optimal K. It involves plotting the inertia (sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center) for different values of K and selecting the K at the "elbow" point where inertia starts decreasing more slowly.
